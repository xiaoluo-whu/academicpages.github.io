Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. applicant applying for CS or ECE Ph.D. programs in 2021 Fall. My research interests lie in software engineering, database, computer vision and machine learning.
I obtained both my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and Master's degree in Signal Processing from <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Wuhan University</a> in 2012 and 2015 respectively. 
I have five years' working experiences as a software engineer. 

## News
* 09/15/2020: I had been writing a <a href="https://xiaoluo-whu.github.io/posts/2020/08/leetcode-experience-overview/" target="_blank">series of blog posts</a> summarizing various kinds of LeetCode algorithm questions. For those who have troubles 
understanding and solving LeetCode questions, you may find many useful tips and code templates in these blog posts.
* 07/16/2020: I passed the admission interview of CUHK.
* 04/15/2020: I was admitted into Computer Science graduate programs of UCDavis and MSU.

## Research Projects
As a graduate student, my research areas included pattern recognition, computer vision and software engineering. The ultimate goal of the projects I did is to build a 
software that can automatically identify printed documents, finding the source printer of a copy of docuemnt quickly and accurately. 

To build a robust and efficient documents verification software, the primary task is to eliminate the influence of different letters' local shape factor and preserve only texture factor.
Here are the two subprojects, corresponding to the two methods we adopt to eliminate shape factor. 

* By using texture synthesis algorithms: Printed Document Verification based on texture synthesis &nbsp;[[**paper**]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-015-2525-5)[[**code**]](https://github.com/xiaoluo-whu/nonparametric_search_texture_synthesis)[[**blog**]]()
* By using the statistic model, two-factor analysis: Printed Document Verification based on two-factor analysis &nbsp;[[**paper**]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiao_Luo27/publication/282924491_Printed_characters'_texture_identification_based_on_two-factor_analysis/links/5dd037e692851c382f44052a/Printed-characters-texture-identification-based-on-two-factor-analysis.pdf)[[**code**]](https://github.com/xiaoluo-whu/printed_document_recognition)[[**blog**]]()

## Industry Projects
I have several years' working experiences as a software engineering. Growing from a junior developer to a senior one, I have participated in
nearly every aspect of industrial software development, including backend, frontend, testing and DevOps. 

* Backend server application of a financial management App with millions scale users. &nbsp;[[**blog**]](https://xiaoluo-whu.github.io/posts/2018/05/leetcode-substring-search/)
* Supply chain management system of an E-commerce company. &nbsp;[[**code**]](https://github.com/xiaoluo-whu/SP)[[**blog**]](https://xiaoluo-whu.github.io/posts/2019/08/review_server_prototype/)
* I once lead a seven members' team to develop a PDF parsing service application. &nbsp;[[**blog**]]()

## Algorithms & LeetCode
I have been solving LeetCode questions since 2014. In total, I have solved 500+ questions. 
I find it a very good way to grasp various data structure and algorithms, which would be very helpful in academia and industry projects.
However, without summarizing previous solved questions and periodically reviewing, it's very easy to forget.

Therefore, I have been writing a <a href="https://xiaoluo-whu.github.io/posts/2020/08/leetcode-experience-overview/" target="_blank">series of blog posts</a> to summarize various LeetCode's algorithm questions. By reading them, you may find 
many useful tips to crack Leetcode questions. I try to put similar and related quetions into one summary post and generalize a code template to 
solve them.

## Recommenders
I have been fortunate to work with or under supervision of some very diligent and smart people in both academia and industry.
They will be my recommenders in my 2021 Fall application season. Should you have 
any questions or doubt about working with me, ask them.
